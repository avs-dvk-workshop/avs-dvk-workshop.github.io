### Create a Custom Skill Using Alexa Skills Kit (ASK)

Navigate to our [Alexa Skill Kit Quick Start Tutorial](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit/alexa-skill-quick-start-tutorial) and follow the instructions to build your own skill in 5 minutes.

Follow the onscreen steps to activate the skill on your device and test it.  Since your skills live in the cloud, once you've published your skill you can access it from any Alexa-enabled device.  Try using your new skill on your neighbor's Intel kit!
