Enable the toggle **"Test is enabled for this skill"**. Now we can perform the test. You can press the microphone icon and say your request or simply type the request in the field to the left of the microphone. Let's stick with the second option and type *"open my raspberry"*, and then press **"Enter"** on the keyboard.
