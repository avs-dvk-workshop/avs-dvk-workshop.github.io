All finished up with the material but want a new challenge?

Here are some ideas:
* Update the skill to support turning on or off all of the LED lights.
* Update the skill to use SSML Audio to return a different noise for the different lights.
* Add a new LED to the breadboard and update the skill and IoT logic to control the new light.
* Indicate the AVS Device State with LEDs, see this link: [https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa-voice-service/indicate-device-state-with-leds.html](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa-voice-service/indicate-device-state-with-leds.html).
