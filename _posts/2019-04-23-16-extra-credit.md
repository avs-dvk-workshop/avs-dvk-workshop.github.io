All finished up with the material but want a new challenge?

Here are some ideas:
* Update the skill to support turning on or off all of the LED lights 
* Update the skill to use SSML Audio to return a different noise for the different lights
* Add a new LED to the breadboard and update the skill and IoT logic to control the new light
