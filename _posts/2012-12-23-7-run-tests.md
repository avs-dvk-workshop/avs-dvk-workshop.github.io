This assumes the build is in the directory created by the script (avs-sdk).

{:.steps}

#### Unit Tests

1. Go to the terminal window, and run the following steps.

```sh
cd $HOME/sdk-folder/sdk-build/
make all test -j3
```

{:.steps}
#### Integration Tests (optional)

Integration tests will take some time to build and run. If the presentation hasn't re-started, then you can move onto this step. Otherwise you can return later and try it out!

1. From the build directory, run 
`TZ=UTC make all integration`
